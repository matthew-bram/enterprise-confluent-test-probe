Generate a comprehensive weekly summary of development activities, organized by day with key themes and patterns identified.

## Process

**Step 1: Gather Weekly Context & Author Info**
- Run `git config --get user.email || echo "unknown@user"` to get current git user
- Extract first 8 characters of `$TERM_SESSION_ID` for Claude session tracking
- Run `git log --oneline --since="7 days ago"` to see all commits
- Run `git log --pretty=format:"%ad %s" --date=short --since="7 days ago"` for daily breakdown
- Analyze commit patterns and identify major themes

**Step 2: Organize by Day**
Group changes by day and identify:
- **Daily Themes**: What was the focus each day
- **Major Accomplishments**: Significant features or fixes completed
- **Recurring Issues**: Problems that appeared multiple times
- **Learning Patterns**: Skills developed or knowledge gained

**Step 3: Generate Weekly Summary**
Create a high-level summary with:

```markdown
## Week of [Date Range]

### Summary
- **Generated by**: user@example.com | Claude:3af31ee9
- **Analysis Period**: Last 7 days
- **Major Accomplishments**: Key features/fixes completed
- **Primary Focus Areas**: What dominated the week's work
- **Technical Decisions**: Important architectural or technology choices
- **Challenges Overcome**: Significant problems solved
- **Knowledge Gained**: New understanding of systems/tools

### Daily Breakdown
#### Monday (2024-01-15)
- Focus: [Primary theme]
- Changes: [Brief summary of changes]

#### Tuesday (2024-01-16)
- Focus: [Primary theme]
- Changes: [Brief summary of changes]

### Patterns & Insights
- **Productivity**: Which days/approaches were most effective
- **Blockers**: What consistently slowed down progress
- **Tools**: Which development tools/commands were most useful
- **Next Week**: Logical next steps based on this week's progress

### Weekly Metadata
- **Report Author**: user@example.com | Claude:3af31ee9
- **Commits Analyzed**: [X] commits across [Y] days
- **Files Modified**: [Z] files with significant changes
```

**Step 4: Identify Growth Areas**
Analyze the week for:
- **Skills Developed**: New technologies or patterns learned
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Better development workflows discovered
- **Code Quality**: Refactoring or testing improvements made
- **Architecture Evolution**: How the system design progressed

## Usage

```bash
/week           # Last 7 days
/week 14        # Last 14 days (bi-weekly)
/week 5         # Last 5 days (work week)
```

This command provides strategic context for planning upcoming work and understanding development velocity and patterns.
